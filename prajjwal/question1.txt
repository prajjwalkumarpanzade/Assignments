Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.

Cherry-pick in Git is like choosing specific changes from one branch and applying them to another. 
It is used when we want certain updates from a particular moment without taking the whole package of changes.

Imagine we have a cake with different layers. Cherry-picking is like taking just the cherries (specific changes) from one slice and putting them on another slice.

Steps to perform cherry-pick:

Switch to branch where we want to add cherry 
git checkout <branch-name>

Pick cherry 
git cherry-pick <commit>
