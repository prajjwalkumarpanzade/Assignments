Q5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

ANS - --force push and --force-with-lease both the methods are used for the the push changes forcefully into the repo.

	--force push 

	git push --force origin <branch name>

	This command forcefully overwrite the remote branch with the local branch.
	It can lead to data loss.

	--force-with-lease

	git push --force-with-lease origin <branch name>.

	This is the safer altenative to the --force push it has low risk of data loss.
	This method checks if the state of remote branch matches with the expected states or not if it matches then 
	it push means if someone else commit the branch then we try to push then push will get rejected.

	Scenario - 
		
		If we are working on team project and and I want to push my changes on remote repo 
		but at same time someone tries to push their changes on same repo then my push request will get rejected 
		so to avoid such rejection and avoid data loss we use --force-with-lease.
